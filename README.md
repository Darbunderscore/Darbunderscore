As a network analyst working in the healthcare industry with over 22 years experience, I write scripts for automating network, Active Directory, file management, SAN, and Citrix tasks.<br>
In my spare time, I play with pihole, Docker, and Plex on my Synology NAS. I also make junk on my Creality Ender 5+ 3d printer and use Octoprint on a Raspberry Pi Zero for sending jobs over Wifi and video monitoring the progress. A newfound hobby is Python.<br>
